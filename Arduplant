  Self-Watering Plant

  Reads a soil moisture sensor and turns on a relay that controls a water pump.
  
  The soil moisture sensor involves a 10K resistor between pins A1 and ground,
  and a probe connected to pin A1 and another connected to +5V. These probes 
  are embedded and inch apart in the plant's soil.

// Analog input pin that the soil moisture sensor is attached to
const int analogInPin = A1;  

// value read from the soil moisture sensor
int sensorValue = 0;

// if the readings from the soil sensor drop below this number, then turn on the pump
int dryValue = 670;

void setup() {
  
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);

//Turns on the water pump if the soil is too dry
  //Increasing the delay will increase the amount of water pumped
  if(sensorValue < dryValue){
    digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  }  
    
  // print the sensor to the serial monitor:
  Serial.print("sensor = " );                       
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  
  

  //slow your roll - I mean... slow down the code a little
  delay(10000);
